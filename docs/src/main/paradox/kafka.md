# Kafka

The **Alpakka Kafka connector** (originally known as **Reactive Kafka** or even **Akka Streams Kafka**) is maintained in a separate repository, but kept after by the Alpakka community.

Please read more about it in the [Alpakka Kafka connector documentation](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-stream-kafka/current/).
